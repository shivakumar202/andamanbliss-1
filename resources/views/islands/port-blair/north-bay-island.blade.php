                                        you need to know about this Hidden Gem in Andaman Island. North Bay Island is a
                                        haven for travelers who want to experience water based activities like Snorkelling,<a

                                        this island is accessible only by boat from Port Blair (Sri Vijaya Puram). North
                                        Bay Island does not have many dining facilities so it would be a smart decision
                                        to carry snacks. We advise visit this island between November And May so that
                                        you can experience the Secluded Beaches In Andaman Islands with the best weather
                                        and crystal clear waters. We also suggest you bring cash as there is no ATM
                                        facility on the Island.

                                        advisablе to considеr postponing scuba diving and snorkеling activitiеs. This is
