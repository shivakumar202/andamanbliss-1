                        <p>To reach Baratang Island, you must first arrive at Port Blair, the entry point to Andaman.
                            From Port Blair, you have three transportation options:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Private AC Bus:</strong> Most comfortable option, with scheduled departures
                                early morning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Private Cab:</strong> Most convenient but slightly more expensive, offering
                                flexibility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Government Bus:</strong> Budget-friendly option with limited schedules.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The journey takes approximately 3-4 hours along the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR), including a
                            vehicle ferry crossing. Two-wheelers are not permitted on this route. All vehicles must
                            travel in a convoy through the Jarawa Tribal Reserve.</p>
