                        <p>To reach Baratang Island, you must first arrive at Port Blair, the entry point to Andaman.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Private AC Bus:</strong> Most comfortable option, with scheduled departures

                            <li><strong>Private Cab:</strong> Most convenient but slightly more expensive, offering

                            <li><strong>Day Trip (1 day):</strong> Sufficient to visit the limestone caves and mud
                                volcanoes. Start early from Port Blair (around 3:00-3:30 AM) to have enough time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overnight Stay (2 days, 1 night):</strong> Recommended if you want to visit
                                Parrot Island, as the parrots return to their nests at sunset. This also allows a more
                                relaxed pace.</li>
                            <li><strong>Extended Stay (3 days, 2 nights):</strong> Ideal for those who want to fully
                                explore all attractions, including Baludera Beach and mangrove forests, at a leisurely
                                pace.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Peak Season (November to February):</strong> Ideal weather with temperatures
                                between 20°C to 30°C, clear skies, and minimal rainfall. Perfect for all activities but
                                expect more tourists.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shoulder Season (October and March-May):</strong> Good weather with fewer
                                crowds. Temperatures may be slightly higher (25°C to 35°C).</li>
                            <li><strong>Monsoon Season (June to September):</strong> Not recommended due to heavy
                                rainfall, rough seas, and limited ferry operations. Some attractions may be
